				The door jingled and Jason Bonetonio walked in. He stood for a moment, shaking rain off his collar and stamping his feet on the welcome mat, before walking up to the counter.
			</p>
			<p>
				"The usual, Bones?" the attendant asked from behind the counter as he rang up a greasy looking hotdog for a man who looked like the last thing he needed was a hotdog.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Yep, today is the day, Kumar, I can feel it," Jason said as he slapped his credit chip on the counter. Kumar added cheese from a bag and put the hot dog in the microwave before reaching under the counter for a Lucky Lunar Lazer lottery scratch-off and handing Jason his credit chip back. Jason picked up the ticket and thumbed the ID patch on the corner to tie it to him and it chirped a cheerful lazer sound in confirmation.

				"Thanks, I'm going to be late for work," Jason said ...
