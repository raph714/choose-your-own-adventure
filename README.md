Welcome to a simple, text based adventure.

## Functions

There are some basic inventory-like functions available to track state, amounts of items or any other minor bits of information. The state is stored in the URL as query parameters. Need a new item or a new state? No problem, add it in the `inventoryKey` object in the `GameState.js` file.

See `GameState.js` for available functions and their usage.
